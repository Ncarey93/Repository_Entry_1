                <p>The purpose of this website to to give information to the reader on the rudimentary aspects of HTML,CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
                <p>Web applications are software programs or applications that are accessed through a web browser over the internet or an intranet. 
                    These applications typically utilize a combination of client-side and server-side technologies to provide interactive and dynamic user experiences.
                    They are built using various web technologies such as HTML and CSS; They communicate with back-end languages such as the popular Python (.py)
                    These web applications store data in a structured format within databases. This data can include user profiles, product information, transaction records, and 
                    when a user interacts with a web application, such as submitting a form or requesting information, the application sends queries to the back-end database to retrieve relevant data.

                    - Document Management Systems<br>
                    - Workflow Automation<br>
                    Some examples of Internet use would be:<br>
                    - E-commerce Platforms<br>
                    - CRM or Customer Relationship Management<br>
                    - Content Management<br>
                    These examples highlight the versatility and importance of web applications in modern businesses, 
                    both for internal operations within an organization (intranet) and for interacting with customers and clients over the internet.
                </p>
                <p>First, HTML is known as "HyperText Markup Language" It is primary use is for web development. 
                    Additionally, this language is one where you have to follow rules when creating a page. (tags are an example)
                    An HTML document typically starts with a "DOCTYPE html" declaration, followed by "html" tags that enclose the entire document. 
                    The document is divided into sections, including "head" "p".
                <br>
                <p>Secondly, CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets is another "tool" when working on a web page in HTML.
                    Without CSS, there would be no design, or color, stlye, pazazz, etc. It allows the page to be formatted and this can be used on multiple HTML pages simultaneously.
                    With CSS, you can target specific HTML elements or groups of elements and apply styles to them. These styles can be defined inline within the HTML document, in a "style" block within the HTML document, 
                    or in an external CSS file that is linked to the HTML document. </p>
                <p>Third, we can use JavaScript, this programming language is used for client-end behavior, where it is based off event code. In otherwords JavaScript is used to control how the site opporates for the client.
                    It's a programming language that brings web pages to life, making them interactive and dynamic. Imagine your web page as a puppet show: HTML provides the puppets (like text, images, buttons), 
                    CSS dresses them up (colors, sizes, positions), and JavaScript pulls the strings, making them move and do tricks.  </p>

                    HTML and CSS were used to create this basic website, and look how nice it is!
